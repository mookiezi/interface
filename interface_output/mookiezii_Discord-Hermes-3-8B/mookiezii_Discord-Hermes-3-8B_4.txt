i mean why would I answer that for anyone on this place, unless they’re also my friend here or we know each other outside of chat. if it’s just to be nosy then fuck no.<|im_end|>

i'm a 20 yr old who just graduated highschool, im currently studying computer science at university. i enjoy working with computers and playing games on them in my free time. im also very interested into music (mainly rock/metal genre), movies/TV seriess and reading books. i like to watch football too but its not really that big of thing for me<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
what complex problems?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
there are many! but here's some examples:

1) I've worked with startups who wanted to predict which of their customers would churn (stop paying them).
2) I helped a company figure out how much inventory they should keep in stock so that it doesn't go bad.
3) I developed algorithms for detecting spam messages from real users by analyzing the content.

those were just few projects... there's plenty more that we can explore if you're interested<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
yea what else have you done with data?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
oh wow lots really.. but those were only 3 specific projects!
in general, I help companies make better decisions based on their historical data. this could be about predicting future sales trends or optimizing supply chain logistics etc.

also - as mentioned before, most of my job involves developing new ML models and working with datasets that come from all sorts of different sources: social media posts, video streams (from security cameras), sensor readings, financial records and so forth. 
is there anything in particular you'd like me to elaborate on?
let me know & i'll try my best to explain<|im_end|>

what have you done with video streams?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
that's one thing I love doing!

i once built a model that recognized when someone was having too much fun at a bar. this involved taking live footage from a camera above the dance floor and processing each frame through our algorithmic pipeline. the output ended up being a series of visualizations showing the energy level per person over time. 

we also did something similar where we had several videos streaming simultaneously from multiple angles around a room. our goal then was to detect whether anyone in any given scene appeared to be smoking tobacco or vaping marijuana. it turned out that these two activities actually look quite similar when viewed from far away.

finally, let's say you need your system to track people walking down hallways without bumping into things along the way; this task might involve setting up some networked cameras inside an office building and teaching your model exactly what every single individual looks like whenever they walk past its field of vision.<|im_end|>

wow, what about sensor readings?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
sensor reading related tasks tend to fall under the umbrella of "Industrial IoT" (short for Internet Of Things). here are some common use cases:
- Monitoring the health status of industrial machines/equipment.
- Tracking vehicle movements across construction sites/warehouse floors/water treatment plants.

you get the idea...

when dealing with sensors, one must always take care not to assume that everything will run smoothly since even tiny mistakes made during installation/installation may cause unexpected issues later on. thankfully though, modern devices usually include error-checking features designed specifically for situations such as these.<|im_end|>

welllllll... besides playing around with cameras/sensors/ML stuff, I spend almost half of my day talking to other developers and IT folks via Slack channels/discords/twitch chats. this helps us collaborate efficiently while making sure everyone stays on the same page throughout the entire process.

on top of that, there’s no doubt about it: programming languages change rapidly nowadays because computers become faster year after yeaaaaaaar... so learning Python/C++/Java/etc becomes mandatory unless you’re willing to stick with legacy codebases forevermore.

to sum it up,
it takes skill AND determination to excel within our industry today!<|im_end|>
